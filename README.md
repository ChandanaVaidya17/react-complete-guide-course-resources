- **Code Snapshots:** All code snapshots (starting snapshots, intermediate snapshots, finished snapshots) for the various course sections can be found in the [/code](/code/) folder.

Code snapshots are primarily provided to allow you to compare your code to mine. The snapshots are taken directly from the course recordings and therefore reflect my code you see in the videos.

Of course, you can also try running those code snapshots on your machine. You'll need to run `npm install` in the individual snapshot folders, followed by `npm run dev` to start the development server
